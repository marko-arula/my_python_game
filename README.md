"Shooting Car"

# Project Title

My first ever game I coded.

## Author

*Marko Arula*

I coded the game mainly myself. Got a bit of help from the teacher.

## Description

I'll start off by saying that this game is really simple, because this is the first game I have ever coded.\
The aim of the game is to kill all the aliens with the ship that I have decided that would be a car. The car is able to shoot as many bullets as you like. You have a total of 3 lives that you can use until you "die". 
Every time you kill one of the moving aliens you get 50 points, which allows you to keep track of how many aliens you have killed. If you do not die, then you are able to basically play forever. Lastly the game does indeed get more difficult the more rounds you survive (meaning aliens will move faster and faster), so be ready!

## Getting Started

Once you boot up the game for the first time, you will want to hit the play button. After that the aliens will start to move from left to right.

### Dependencies

You will indeed have to import a plugin called pygame if you are using pycharm for example.\
You may use any OS that supports python codes.

### Installing

At the moment I believe the best way to play this game is to download it and then use a program called PyCharm, or anything that is similar to the program. Once you download both the program and the game, then you should be able to unzip and insert the files of the game into the program. And before you launch the game you will need to import a plugin called pygame. (*import pygame*)
